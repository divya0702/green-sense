# 🌿 Green Sense

**AI-Powered Energy & Sustainability Intelligence**

Green Sense transforms ordinary energy bills into actionable sustainability insights using **Google’s Gemini Generative AI**.
Upload a utility bill → get your carbon footprint, cost breakdown, and personalized reduction strategies — all in one dashboard.

---

## ✨ Description

**Green Sense** is a web application that helps users and organizations **analyze, track, and reduce their carbon footprint** by converting raw energy bills into detailed sustainability reports.

It integrates **Gemini’s multimodal AI** and real-time data APIs to provide:

* **Energy & CO₂ Analysis:** Automatically extract key metrics from uploaded PDFs (using Gemini API).
* **AI Chatbot:** Interactive Gemini-powered assistant that explains your energy data and suggests cost-saving strategies.
* **Leaderboard:** Compare your organization’s footprint with peers for gamified sustainability tracking.
* **Visual Reports:** Auto-generated graphs and summaries for monthly and yearly trends.

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have:

* **Node.js** ≥ 18.x
* **npm** ≥ 9.x
* **MongoDB URI** (Atlas or local instance)
* **Gemini API key** from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
* **Git**

---

## 🚀 Setup and Run

### **Backend Setup**

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file:

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=8080
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

Start the backend:

```bash
npm start
```

Backend runs at **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**

---

### **Frontend Setup**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

Serve the build:

```bash
npm install -g serve
serve -s dist/greensense
```

Frontend runs locally on **[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)**

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

| Issue                 | Fix                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Backend not starting  | Check `.env` and MongoDB URI                    |
| Gemini not responding | Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` and API endpoint        |
| Build fails           | Ensure Node 18+ and correct dependency versions |
| Charts not loading    | Verify backend endpoints and data schema        |
| CORS errors           | Add appropriate middleware in `app.js`          |
